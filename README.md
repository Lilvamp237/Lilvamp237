## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hi, I'm Sumudu Ratnayake!

### Aspiring ML, Data, and Software Engineer

[cite_start]A passionate Computer Science undergraduate (Current GPA: 3.8/4.0 [cite: 22, 54, 81, 111, 143][cite_start]) from General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University[cite: 22, 54, 81, 110, 142]. [cite_start]I thrive on building and analyzing **AI/ML-driven** and **scalable software systems**[cite: 6, 36, 63, 126]. [cite_start]I have a strong foundation in algorithmic problem-solving [cite: 7, 27, 37, 56, 64, 85, 93, 118, 126, 148] and am actively seeking an internship opportunity.
